### Jump

Before jumping, it is important to check if you are standing on the 'ground',
as you could otherwise jump in the air! Here is shown one of the ways this can
be solved. You move your 'collision box' slightly down and see if it
overlaps with the ground.

```csharp
[SerializeField] LayerMask groundLayer;

void Update()
{
    if (jumpKey && GroundCheck())
        Jump();
}

bool GroundCheck()
{
    var coll = GetComponent<CapsuleCollider2D>();
    return Physics2D.CapsuleCast(coll.bounds.center, coll.bounds.size, CapsuleDirection2D.Vertical, 0f, Vector2.down, 0.1f, groundLayer
    );
}
```

*Ground Layer* must be set in the **Inspector** to the layer that is
*Ground*.

Here a CapsuleCollider is used, but it works with other colliders
as well.

The number 0.1f indicates how much the collider is moved down. You can adjust
this number a bit to get the best effect.
