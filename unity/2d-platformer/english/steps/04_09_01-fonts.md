### Fonts

By default, Unity only has one font. You can easily install more fonts and
get a cooler look that way. The fonts can be found, among other places, at the link
at the bottom of this document.

Create a folder under **Assets** and call it **Fonts**. The fonts you
want to use should then be dragged into this folder. When this is done,
the font can be used in the text object by clicking on
<img src="../media/image56.png"
style="width:0.19792in;height:0.20833in" /> next to **Font**.

<img src="../media/image57.png"
style="width:5.40625in;height:1.56667in" />
