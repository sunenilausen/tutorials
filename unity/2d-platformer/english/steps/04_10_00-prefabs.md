## Prefabs

Prefabs are copies of entire objects (templates), which can then be inserted
again and again. This is the way you can copy an object many times in
the same game, such as enemies and coins.

They are created by using the mouse to click on the desired object and then dragging it
down into the **Prefabs** folder under **Assets**. (If the folder doesn't exist,
it should be created first). After that, they can be inserted into the game by
dragging them from the **Prefabs** folder into the game (**Scene**).
