1.  Click on **Publish->WebGL Project**.

2.  Select **Build and Publish** and then **Switch to WebGL**.

3.  Click on **Select Folder** (without selecting anything).

Now the entire project needs to be compiled and uploaded to the web. This takes
some time. When it's done, it opens a window in the browser. Here
you can enter a name for the game and add an icon. Remember to click
**Save**. Now the game can be played by clicking **Play**. The link to
the game is in the address field at the top of the browser (as usual).

If you make changes to your game, you only need to repeat the process
from clicking on **Publish**.
