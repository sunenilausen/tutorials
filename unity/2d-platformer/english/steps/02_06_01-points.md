### Points

Right now no points are displayed, as we are not counting any points!

12. Now create a variable called *points* of type *int*. Count it up each
    time you take a fruit. (Use the following lines)
    ```csharp
    int points;
    ```

13. You display the points by updating the line with the Score text to
    the following:

```csharp
scoreText.text = "Score: " + points;
```

Try and see how it works.

14. If you want the different fruits to give different
    points, it can be done in the following way:

```csharp
if (collision.gameObject.name.Contains("Cherries"))
    points += 20;
```
