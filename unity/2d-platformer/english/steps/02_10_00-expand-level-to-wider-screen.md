## Expand level to a wider screen

We're starting to run out of space in our game, so it's time to
make the level wider. This requires the camera to follow the *Player*, so we can still
see what's happening.

1.  Find the *CameraFollower* script and drag it over the *Main Camera* in
    the **Hierarchy**.

2.  Select *Main Camera* and drag the *Player* object into **Player** in
    the **Inspector**.

Now the camera should follow the *Player* and you can therefore expand your
level in width and height.
