## Smooth surface

If you don't want to be able to "stick" to walls and platform sides, then
they need to have a smooth surface. This is done by creating a physical surface
under the **Assets** folder (**Create->2D->Physics Material 2D**) and
setting **Friction** to 0. Then select it in the **Collider** under
**Material** for the surface you want to be 'smooth'.
