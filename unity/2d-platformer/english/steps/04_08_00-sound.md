## Sound

To get sound in your games, you must first find some sound files and place
them in **Assets/Sounds/**. For the *object* that you want sound support
for, you must first add an **AudioSource** component. In the script for
that *object*, you do the following:

```csharp
[SerializeField] AudioClip jumpSound;

AudioSource audioPlayer;

void Start()
{
    audioPlayer = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
}

void Update()
{
    if (jump)
        audioPlayer.PlayOneShot(jumpSound, 1.0f);
}
```

You must then drag the sound file over to the **Jump Sound** field in
the **Inspector** that you want to use.
