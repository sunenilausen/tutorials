## Assets Folders

It is a good idea to organize all your files as you go, as it can otherwise
be difficult to find them later. It is therefore a good idea to
start by creating the following folders under **Assets**:

- *Scripts* (for all C# scripts)

- *Animator* (for all animations)

- *PreFabs* (for all PreFabs)

There will be a need for more folders as you develop your
game. In addition, the assets you download from the *Asset Store* will automatically
come in separate folders.
