# 2D Platform Game

This tutorial will walk through how to create a 2D Platform game â€“ see
the front page of this document.

Generally, all C# code is marked with this font, and all references to
**Unity GUI are marked with this font**. Let's get started.

1.  Open Unity HUB and create a new project by clicking **New
    Project** in the upper right corner. Choose **2D** and give it a name, e.g.
    **2dplatform_game** and click **Create project**. It takes some time...
    The program that appears will be called **the GUI** from now on.

2.  The first thing to do is import the starter package we need to
    use. It's located here:
    <https://github.com/mhfalken/unity/blob/main/2dplatform.unitypackage>
    Choose download and save the file somewhere you can find it again.

3.  In the GUI: **Assets->Import Package->Custom package** and select
    the above file. In the window that appears, click **Import**
    in the bottom right corner. The package is now imported and is located under
    **Assets**.

4.  Select **Assets/Levels** and double click on **Level1**. Delete
    the **Assets/Scenes** folder.

Right now there should be 6 green squares in the **Scene** window.
