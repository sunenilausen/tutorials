### Platform

If it is a platform that should move, it is important that you have
set **Layer** to *Ground* for the platform and added a **Collider**.
If the platform runs to the sides, the *Player* falls off, as the *Player*
does not automatically follow the platform. This can be solved by adding
the script *StickyPlatform* to the *Platform*.
