## Keys

When you need to read which keys are being pressed, you can advantageously
use GetAxisRaw(), which unlike a specific key is a collection
of keys that are more generic. For example, if you want to move a character to
the sides, then both the A, D keys, left and right arrow keys will work as well as a
joystick (Horizontal).

The individual combinations can be found in **Edit->Project Settings->Input
Manager**.
```csharp
float dir;

dir = Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal"); // [-1, 0, 1]
```

For jumping, you should use this function, as it requires that you release
the key before you can jump again.

```csharp
float jumpKey;

jumpKey = Input.GetButtonDown("Jump");
```
