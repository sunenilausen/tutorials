## Sound

The game is a bit quiet, so it's time to add some sound. There are
already some sound files in the **Assets/Sounds/** folder. By
double-clicking on them, you can hear how they sound.

For the *object* that you want sound support for, you must first add
an **AudioSource** component.

1.  Select *Player* and add **AudioSource**.

2.  In the *PlayerController* script, insert these lines in the 'right'
    places in the code (hint: the lines are in the correct order).

```csharp
[SerializeField] AudioClip jumpSound;

AudioSource audioPlayer;

void Start()
{
    audioPlayer = GetComponent<AudioSource>();
}

// When jumping:
audioPlayer.PlayOneShot(jumpSound, 1);
```

3.  The first line creates a field in the **Inspector** that you need to
    drag the sound you want to use for jumping into.

![](media/image28.png){ width=6.56597in height=0.26597in }

The last line plays the actual sound file, and should be placed where you
jump.

Try if the sound works when you jump.

You can add more sounds by creating these two lines for each sound.

```csharp
[SerializeField] AudioClip itemSound;

...

audioPlayer.PlayOneShot(itemSound, 1);
```

The first line is used to select which sound file you want and the
second line plays the sound file. It's important to remember to drag
a sound file into the **Inspector** for each sound.

![](media/image29.png){ width=6.56597in height=0.57778in }

In the case where we die, we need to wait a bit before destroying
our *Player*, as the sound would otherwise disappear too.

4.  This is done by adding an extra parameter to Destroy(...), which
    tells how long to wait. Below we wait 1 second,
    which should be enough time to play a small sound.

```csharp
Destroy(gameObject, 1);
```
