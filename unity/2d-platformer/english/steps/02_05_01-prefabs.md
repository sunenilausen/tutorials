### PreFabs

When you have finished making your fruit, you should create a *PreFab*. A
*PreFab* is a template that you can use again and again.

1.  First create a folder under **Assets** called **PreFabs**.

2.  Now drag *Cherries* from the **Hierarchy** down into the **PreFabs** folder.

Now make some more different fruits and create **PreFabs** for each of
them, so you get a small collection in **PreFabs**.

When you later want to use a fruit in your game, you just drag one
from the **PreFabs** folder directly into the **Scene** where you want it
and then they work. You just need to move them to the right place in
the game.

When you get many fruits, your **Hierarchy** becomes a bit messy.

3.  Create a **Create** **Empty** object in the **Hierarchy** and call it
    *Fruits*. Here Unity does something a bit annoying – it sets the Z
    position to something other than 0! Fix this in the **Inspector** by
    setting it to 0 – see image.

4.  Drag all the fruits under this new object to get a bit more
    order.
