## Inspiration for further development

Player jump animation

Multiple lives, save points (so you don't have to start completely over each time)

Better sound – near/far

Boxes that can be moved and climbed on

Rolling stone ball like Indiana Jones

Climbing up plants on walls, beanstalk

Build – release on the web
