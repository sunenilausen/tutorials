This is a guide on how to create a small 2D platform game in Unity,
as shown in the image. It includes everything from a starter package to a
complete walkthrough of how to do it.

There is no specific C# teaching, but most of the code you
need to use is shown with examples. On my github lies the complete
"solution" as a packaged file

<https://github.com/mhfalken/unity/blob/main/2dplatform_final.zip>

There is also a list of tips, if you already know a bit about Unity.

Documents also contain some links to good videos at the bottom.

The document and code were made in Unity version 2020.3. It should also
work in other versions, but there may be small differences. (The document has been
updated to also fit 2021.3).
