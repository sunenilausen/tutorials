# Guidelines for Claude in tutorials repository

## Repository Structure
- Tutorials organized by technology (`javascript/`, `unity/`, `arcade-makecode/`)
- Each technology has language subdirectories (`english/`, `dansk/`)
- Files are numbered sequentially (01-, 02-, etc.)
- Files are not allowed to have danish letters, but should use ae, oe, aa instead of æ, ø, å
- Supporting media stored in `images/` or `media/` folders

## Content Guidelines
- Markdown files with code blocks using triple backticks and language identifiers (```javascript)
- Tutorial files should be concise and focused on one concept
- Include explanatory text and code examples
- Reference images with relative paths

## Code Style
- JavaScript: Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Keep code examples simple and accessible to beginners
- Include comments for complex operations
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Translation
- When adding new content, create both English and Danish versions
- Maintain consistent structure between language versions
