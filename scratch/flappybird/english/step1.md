We're making a new project and start by deleting the cat.

Now we're in drawing mode for a new sprite, where we select the circle tool.

A flappy bird is really just made of a bunch of circles, so start by drawing its body with a long purple oval.

Then make a white circle for the wing and another white circle for the eye.

Use the brush tool to make a dot in the eye.
