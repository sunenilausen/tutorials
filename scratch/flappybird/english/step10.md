# Bonus: Counting score

We want to find out who is the best, so we better find a way to count the points.

You should create a new variable called “points”, and then add blocks so we increase it every second:

But as a challenge, maybe you could instead make, for example, an apple sprite that increases our points when we touch it?

Then reset the apple back to the right side, just like a pipe that moves left and resets if the player hits it.

Think of it as combining what you’ve done with the pipes with a points-giving object.
