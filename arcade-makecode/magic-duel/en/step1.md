In this tutorial we will be making a game where a witch and fairy throws fireballs at eachother.

### Step 1: Open MakeCode Arcade & Create a New Project

    1. Go to the MakeCode Arcade website (just search for "MakeCode Arcade" online, or go to arcade.makecode.com).
    2. Click the big "+ New Project" button.
    3. Give your project a name, like "Magic Duel".
    4. Click "Create".

You'll see your coding area. On the left is the simulator (where your game runs), in the middle is the toolbox with all the code blocks, and on the right is the workspace where you'll build your code.



###  Step 2: Add Multiplayer Power!

Our game needs two players, so we need the Multiplayer blocks.

    Look at the bottom of the toolbox (the middle section). You'll see "Extensions". Click it.
    Find the "Multiplayer" extension (it usually has a picture of 2 people playing a game). Click on it to add it to your toolbox. You'll see new blocks appear, probably colored dark teal!

Okay, let's build a super cool 2-player shooting game using MakeCode Arcade! Imagine a witch and a faerie having a magical duel. We'll learn how to code it step-by-step, understanding *why* we're doing each part.

**What is Coding?**

Think of coding like giving very specific instructions to a computer, like writing a recipe. Computers need exact steps! MakeCode Arcade uses colorful blocks that snap together, making it easier to give these instructions.

**Our Goal:** Build a game where two players control characters, shoot projectiles, score points when they hit the other player, and the first to 10 points wins!

**Let's Start Coding!**

**Step 1: Setting Up Your Project**

1.  Go to the MakeCode Arcade website (`arcade.makecode.com`).
2.  Click the big "**+ New Project**" button.
3.  Name your project (e.g., "Magic Duel Code") and click "**Create**".

You'll see:
* **Simulator:** Where your game runs (left).
* **Toolbox:** Where all the code blocks live (middle).
* **Workspace:** Where you build your code (right).

Notice the `on start` block already there?
* **Coding Concept: Events.** An "event" is something that happens in the game. The `on start` block is an **event handler** â€“ it holds the code that runs *only once*, right when the game begins. It's like the starting whistle!

**Step 2: Adding Multiplayer Tools**

Our game needs two players, so we need special blocks.

1.  Look at the bottom of the toolbox and click "**Extensions**".
2.  Find and click the "**Multiplayer**" extension. Poof! New purple blocks appear in your toolbox.
* **Coding Concept: Libraries/Extensions.** Think of extensions like adding extra tools to your toolkit. They give you new blocks (new commands or instructions) that let your program do specific things, like handling two players at once.
