# 01 - Variables and Types

Open the secret window: press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `i` (or right-click and "Inspect"). Go to "Console."

Let's make **variables** to hold info! Type these and press Enter after each:

```javascript
name = "Your Name"
age = Your Age
```

(Put your name in the quotes `" "` and your age as a number.)

Now, see what's inside your **variables**! Type:

```javascript
name
```

or

```javascript
age
```

`name` and `age` are **variables** that store information. The **type** of information matters!

* Text in quotes `" "` is a **string** (for words).
* Whole numbers (like your age) are **integers** (for counting).

You just created your first variables and learned about types! ðŸŽ‰
